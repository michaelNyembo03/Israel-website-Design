            <h2>Israel culture and art</h2>
            <ol>
              <li id="life">Life Style</li>
                 <p>Israel is a nominal democracy and a de facto oligarchy, very much like the U.S. and the U.K. and for a good reason: Israel is a former U.K. territory* and a current U.S. client state, meaning the government does whatever it wishes to serve the “masters” (whoever happens to fund them, just like the States) regardless of what people/voters actually want.

This means that most Israelis make very little money, have jobs they don’t really care for, live in sub-standard conditions, move around in bad infrastructure etc. Basically, it’s like Eastern Europe only the houses aren’t pretty and the food is super expensive. The median monthly wages in 2016 were around 1700$. (I personally haven’t made that much money in 7 years.) Since food is around 1000$ a month and rent is at least 700$ a month, you can infer that a huge chunk of the population just can’t make ends meet, despite not being technically poor. This is why the Neo-Liberal experiment is so dangerous: it never works, it only transfers money from the poor to the rich (Israel used to be super socialist so living conditions were pretty sweet in some regards) and makes the middle class impoverished.<br>
Now what’s the Israeli way of life? Given the above, very simple: you do your job and in your spare time you have fun. My brother once cleverly noted that Israelis usually don’t have hobbies for a very simple reason: they don’t have an expendable income. Israelis have 3 major hobbies: TV, the internet and the beach. The first two are relatively cheap in Israel compared to anything else and the beach is a natural resource. The Israeli philosophy is often summed up in one sentence: אם מצחיק, צוחקים, translated roughly to “if it’s funny, laugh” (implicating not stifling laughter, like in Anglo-Saxon countries where there are numerous taboos on what you can say and when you can laugh).

(Now, given this lifestyle, you might understand better why it is so hard to convince Israelis that the occupation is not only for realzies but also very dangerous both for Israel and for the people under it? Yeah, it’s hard to convince someone of anything when they’re preoccupied with how they’re gonna make it through the month. Hint: boycotts don’t work. Giving people back their freedoms does.)

* It’s called the British “mandate” and Israel wasn’t a “colony” or a “territory”, as many British people cared to point out to me last time I brought this up. I try to use language advisedly, though. I say that whoever was running around with guns shooting or threatening civilians is in charge regardless of label. The British were given a mandate to govern until two states came to be but I don’t know if you were taught this (probably not), they weren’t too keen on letting Israel go, as in turning away holocaust survivors (or putting them in new camps set up north - yeah you heard it right! The Brits set up concentration camps to house refugees from concentration camps).

The soldiers took their job as a mandate to rape and pillage and again, I use those words advisedly, because when multiple old ladies break down in tears and tell you how the British soldiers raped or tried to rape them and other such lovely stories of the time, you start realizing that whenever the language police shows up, it’s usually because they’re trying to cover up something or control the narrative (or both).

                    <li>Birkat Kohanim</li>
                      <p>An awe-inspiring celebration, Birkat Kohanim sees ten of thousands of people gathering at the Kotel (Western Wall) to witness the priestly blessing. Jewish men belonging to the Kohanim tribe cover their head with their prayer shawl (tallit) and bless the crowd with a millenia old prayer during the morning prayer.</p>
                    <li>Tel Aviv Night Run</li>
                      <p>A favourite with runners, this 10km race takes place at nighttime to offer its 25,000 participants a different view of Tel Aviv. Open to anyone over 14 who can present a doctor’s note attesting their fitness levels, the race departs from Rabin Square, the city’s hub for all major events, and closes with a celebratory finish line festival at Ganei Yehoshua.</p>
                    <li>Taste of Galilee Food Festival</li>
                       <p>Set in the green and relaxing Galilee region, this annual celebration of Israeli gastronomy will appeal to foodies. The week-long event features workshops, special events hosted by restaurants in the area, as well as a focus on specific local produce.</p>
                    <li>Christmas in Bethlehem</li>
                          <p>A wonderful way to celebrate Christmas is to spend the evening of the birth of Jesus in the very city where he was born. Before watching the midnight mass or inside the church or on a giant screen on Manger’s Square, you’ll have the chance to visit Bethlehem's key site related to Jesus’ birth, the Church of the Nativity.</p>
                    <li>Red Sea Jazz Festival Eilat</li>
                             <p>Not one just for jazz aficionados, this well established festival taking place in the south of Israel also welcomes world music (from the Balkans to Cuba), Middle Eastern sounds, and pop music. Around 35 events are held with the magnificent backdrop of the Red Sea in Eilat. A great feature of this festival, happening in winter and summer, is the free jam sessions.</p>

                  </ul>
                  <li id="religion">Religion</li>
                     <p>Religious Beliefs. Judaism is the official religion. Eighty percent of the population are Jewish, 15 percent are Muslim, and 4 percent are Christian or Druze. Jews believe in the Hebrew Bible, or Tenakh, which corresponds to the Christian Old Testament. The most sacred text is the Torah, or the five books of Moses. The Bible is seen as both historical record and religious law. Different communities follow the Holy Book with varying degrees of literalness. The strictest are the ultra-Orthodox, who believe that the Scriptures were physically handed down from God. There are also Conservative, Reform, and Reconstructionist congregations, who interpret the law more leniently, and who allow women more of a role in the religion. There also are different sects of Judaism, such as the Hasidim and the Lubbavicher.

There are five pillars of faith that Muslims follow. They are: a declaration of faith in Allah; praying five times a day; giving alms to the poor; fasting from sunrise to sundown during the holy month of Ramadan; and making a pilgrimage at some point in one's life to the holy city of Mecca.

Religious Practitioners. Rabbis are the religious leaders of the Jewish community. They are ordained in Jewish law, and often are scholars in addition to delivering sermons and offering spiritual guidance. The Chief Rabbinate is a body of rabbis who make the religious laws to which Israeli Jews are subject.

The main religious figures in the Muslim community are muezzins, who are scholars of the Koran and sound the call to prayer from mosques.

Rituals and Holy Places. Jews worship in synagogues. In the most traditional, men sit in the front and women in the back, separated by a partition, or in a balcony. There are a number of places in Israel, in Jerusalem in particular, that have religious significance to Jews, Muslims, and Christians. The Dome of the Rock is an ancient Muslim shrine. Christians often make pilgrimages to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, also in Jerusalem. The Wailing Wall, the remains of the Temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E. , is a sacred spot for Jews. There is a separate section of the wall for men and women. People often write their prayers on pieces of paper and slip them in cracks between the stones. The Jewish New Year, called Rosh Hashana, falls in September or October. Jews attend synagogue for two days and listen to readings from the Torah. The ten days following Rosh Hashana are known as the Days of Awe, a period of reflection and penitence. This culminates in Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, and the holiest day of the year. Jews fast from sundown to sundown and attend synagogue, where they repent for their sins and ask God to be inscribed in the Book of Life for another year. Sukkot, the harvest festival, is later in the fall. Hanukkah, which falls in December, is an eight-day holiday celebrating the victory of the Maccabees over the Greeks in C.E. 165. Purim, in the spring, celebrates Queen Esther's outsmarting Haman, who wished to kill the Jewish people. Passover, which falls later in the spring, remembers Jewish liberation from slavery in Egypt.

The bar mitzvah (for boys) or bat mitzvah (for girls) is an important coming-of-age ceremony in Judaism. Children study for years to prepare for the event that occurs when they turn thirteen. They are called to read from the Torah before the congregation; the service is followed by a party with food and dancing.

Death and the Afterlife. Judaism focuses more on the here and now, rather than the concept of an afterlife. A death is followed by a mourning period of seven days, a process called sitting shiva , during which friends and relatives pay visits to the family of the deceased and bring food. Mourners dress in black, sit on low stools, and recite prayers. Another traditional practice is for mourners to tear their clothes; today they generally rip only the lapel of their shirts. When visiting a Jewish cemetery, it is customary to place a stone on the gravestone in memory of the deceased.

                      <p>Israel has a well-developed health care system. It has one of the highest ratios of doctors to general population in the world. Since independence, sanitation has improved, and the rate of infectious diseases has decreased. Histadrut, the labor federation, runs Kupat Cholim, or Sick Fund, which provides health care to members through regional hospitals and local clinics. The Ministry of Health provides for those who do not receive care from a sick fund. In general, Jews receive better health care than Arabs. The life expectancy is longer for Jews, and the infant mortality rate is significantly lower.

                     <p>For such a young country, Israel has a seriously enviable food culture. It’s certainly Middle Eastern in nature, but what makes it so unique is the huge number of international influences that have helped shape it into what it is today. So many people have made the country their home over the years, coming from all over, and the large communities from North Africa and places like Georgia means there’s some seriously interesting (and tasty) dishes to eat your way through. And more often than not, the best places to find these flavours are at market stalls and tiny hole-in-the-wall restaurants.

Israeli street food is the perfect representation of the country’s food culture, with dozens of different delicacies just waiting to be tasted. Walk through the bustling markets of Jerusalem or Tel-Aviv and you’ll soon realise there’s plenty to see, do and taste, with vendors calling to the crowds, queues forming for falafel stands and pretty much everyone delving into something delicious. Take a look at the street foods we think should be top of your list when visiting Israel, and get ready to fulfil your chickpea and pitta bread quota for the year.</p>

                  <p>Since the establishment of the State of Israel, sports have played an increasingly important role in the development of the country both at home and on the international stage. Despite its small population, Israel’s athletes, such as tennis star Shahar Pe’er and soccer player Yossi Benayoun, have achieved international recognition. Israeli sports teams have also found success abroad, most notably the Maccabi Tel Aviv basketball club, which has consistently ranked among the best teams in Europe and won multiple championships. Israel’s national teams, especially in soccer and basketball have also been improving.<br><br>

Outside of the professional arena, sports have always been a significant pastime for hundreds of thousands of Israelis. With miles of beautiful coastline on the country’s western border it’s no surprise that an estimated half of the population swim regularly. The many months of warm weather encourage Israelis to enjoy outdoor sports, and a competitive attitude ensures youngsters become involved in dozens of different sporting activities from a young age.<br><br>

<span id="soccer" style="color:red">Soccer</span><br><br>
Soccer just edges basketball as the most popular sport in Israel. The professional soccer league, with 12 teams in the top Premier League division, is followed closely in the media and attracts crowds of up to 20,000 people at games. After half a decade at the top, Maccabi Haifa's era of unrivaled success appears to be waning, with Betar Jerusalem taking over, having won the league championship for the first time in nine years in May 2007.<br><br>

Israeli clubs continue to improve in European competition, and Maccabi Haifa reached the quarterfinals of the Champions League in 2003 and 2010.<br><br>

Israeli soccer players are having an increasing impact on the world stage. In the summer of 2007, Israel captain Yossi Benayoun moved to Liverpool FC and defender Tal Ben Haim to Chelsea, while in January 2008, Tamir Cohen joined Bolton Wanderers. In November 2017, Israeli soccer star Eran Zahavi was named the Most Valuable Player in the Chinese Super League, after finishing the season as the league's top goal scorer. Before being recruited by the Guangzhou R&F club in 2015, Zahavi played for the Maccabi Tel Aviv team in Israel.<br><br>

Israel participates in the Homeless World Cup, a soccer competition run by the Homeless World Cup Foundation. The organization hopes to alleviate homelessness worldwide by providing a social safety net and self-confidence to homeless individuals. Israel is one of 74 countries, including the United States, that participate in the Homeless World Cup, which draws an annual attendance of approximately 80,000 people.<br><br>

In November 2017, FIFA, the international governing body of professional football, rejected a Palestinian Football Association request to take punitive action against Israeli soccer teams based in settlements beyond the Green Line. The Palestinian group argued that the Israeli teams violated FIFA rules forbidding teams from playing in another nation’s territory without permission. FIFA rejected the Palestinian arguments, based on the fact that there is no permanent, recognized border in the area.<br><br>

<span id="basketball" style="color:red">Basketball</span><br><br>
Maccabi Tel Aviv are the kings of Israeli basketball, having won nearly every league championship. Maccabi also won the Euroleague championship in 2014 and back-to-back in 2004 and 2005. Overall, Maccabi owns six Euroleague trophies. In 2009, former Maccabi player Omri Casspi made history as the first Israeli to play in the NBA, after he was drafted by the Sacramento Kings.<br><br>

Hapoel Jerusalem has also had success in the European arena, competing in the ULEB Cup, a competition it won in 2005. In 2009, it again qualified for the Biannual EuroBasket championship, an event it has participated in since 1993.<br><br>

Women’s basketball is popular in Israel, with two teams – Elitzur Ramle and Anda Ramat Hasharon – regularly battling for the league title. The two also compete in European competition. Shay Doron became the first Israeli to play professional basketball in America in 2007, playing for the New York Liberty in the WNBA.<br><br>

The Basketball Without Borders program sponsored a camp in Israel featuring current and former NBA players and coaches during August 2017. Sixty of the top under-17 basketball players throughout Europe and the Middle East participated in the program and trained under the professional players. Additionally, Basketball Without Borders brought Israeli and Palestinian children together to play games and sponsored a new area for children at the Jerusalem YMCA. Basketball Without Borders has held camps in 26 countries since its founding in 2001, and this was the first time that Israel hosted a camp.<br><br>

Israel's national under-20 basketball team won their first ever European Championship title in July 2018, beating the Croatian team 80-66.<br><br><br>

<span id="tennis" style="color:red">Tennis</span><br><br>
In recent years Israeli tennis players have become a fixture at the world’s biggest tournaments. Teenager Shahar Pe’er broke into the world's top 20 in 2006 and performs well at WTA-ranked tournaments around the world, including reaching the doubles finals of the Australian Open in 2008.<br>

Doubles pair Andy Ram and Yoni Erlich have also established themselves as one of the best in the world, winning the 2008 Australian Open and staying in the world’s top 10 for years. Ram has also excelled in the mixed doubles competitions. In 2006, he won Wimbledon with Russian Vera Zvonerava and, in 2007, captured the French Open with his French partner Nathalie Dechy.<br><br>

Israel also regularly participates in the Davis Cup competition. In 2009, the team reached the semifinal for the first time in its history.<br><br>

<span id="wingate" style="color:red">The Wingate Institute</span><br><br>
An important factor in the success and development of Israeli sports is the Wingate Institute of Physical Education, the national sports center based in its own grounds close to the city of Netanya in central Israel. The institute includes an elite school for gifted young sports students, as well as the Department of Sports Medicine, a world leader in the field. The Council for Sporting Excellence, which determines which talented athletes will receive stipends to train full time, is also based at Wingate. Numerous successful Israeli athletes, including Pe'er, Ram, and Erlich, began their careers at Wingate.<br><br>

The Sports Authority of the Ministry of Science, Culture, and Sport sponsors the training of instructors and coaches at Wingate and oversees all sporting activity in Israel, coordinating the activities of the various sports federations and organizations and assisting in the development of programs.<br><br>

<span id="youngsters" style="color:red">Youngsters playing sports</span><br><br><br>
A sporting culture developed from the early years of the state, with youngsters encouraged to become involved in sports from a young age to promote both fitness and healthy competitiveness. Each week, hundreds of thousands of young Israelis participate in sports ranging from soccer and basketball to kayaking, sailing, and rock climbing.<br><br>

A number of major sports organizations run a network of clubs around the country as well as being affiliated to the major sports teams. The most well-known include Maccabi (established 1912), Hapoel (1923), Betar (1924), Elitzur (1939), and the Academic Sports Association – ASA (1953). Schools and community centers also run local leagues and competitions with the national school basketball and soccer finals broadcast on national television.<br><br>

Israel was home to the International Children's Games during early August 2018, hosting 750 boys and 750 girls from 29 countries in Jerusalem for the event. The International Children's Games is held in a different city around the globe every year, and is an official organization of the International Olympic Committee.  Children aged 12-15 participated in nine sports over the three-day event: basketball, soccer, street ball, volleyball, fencing, judo, athletics, tennis and swimming.<br><br>

<span id="hobby" style="color:red">Sports as a hobby</span><br><br><br>
On any weekend visitors will see groups of people playing basketball on outside courts in parks around the country, going running in the streets, and playing soccer in the parks. The beaches provide a great opportunity for water sports. Israel has the highest per capita number of qualified scuba divers in the world, with 50,000 attracted by the unique marine life of the Mediterranean and Red Sea. Windsurfing and water skiing are also popular as well as Matkot, a locally developed beach game played by keeping a ball in the air by hitting it from paddle to paddle.<br><br>

Away from the beaches, long-distance running is also high on the list of popular sports, with thousands participating in the annual marathon around Lake Kinneret in the North, beginning and ending in Tiberias. Jerusalem and Tel Aviv also have annual marathons. More than 35,000 runners from 72 different countries participated in the 2018 Jerusalem Marathon, the largest participation in the event's history.<br><br>

In the winter, Mount Hermon in the North has become a beacon for local skiers. Other popular sports include cycling table tennis, boxing, wrestling, weightlifting, judo, karate, and a form of self-defense called Krav Maga, developed by the IDF. Popular team sports include volleyball and handball, which both have their own professional leagues in Israel.<br><br>

<span id="Olympics" style="color:red">Olympics & Maccabiah</span><br><br><br>
Israel has always prided itself on its Olympic success, but until 2004 had never won a gold medal. That changed when windsurfer Gal Fridman beat the competition at the 2004 Athens Games. Arik Zeevi also won a medal at Athens, taking a bronze in the judo competition. In the 2008, Beijing Olympics Shahar Zubari won a bronze in men’s sailboard.<br><br>

Other medal winners include Yael Arad and Oren Smadja (silver and bronze in judo in Barcelona, 1992) and Michael Kalganov (bronze in kayaking, Sydney, 2000). Pole vaulter Alex Averbukh never won an Olympic medal but won bronze and silver medals at the 1999 and 2001 World Athletics Championships, and the gold medal at the 2002 and 2006 European Athletic Championships.<br><br>

Israel sent its largest delegation ever to the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janiero, Brazil. The team of 48 athletes competed in 16 events, including golf, mountain biking, and the triathlon for the first time.<br><br>

Every four years Israel hosts its own version of the Olympics – the Maccabiah Games, which since 1932 has brought together thousands of Jewish athletes from all over the world. It is one of only seven worldwide competitions recognized by the International Olympic Committee. Participants compete in events such as soccer, basketball, table tennis, and netball and attend an impressive opening ceremony at the National Stadium in Ramat Gan. Many top Jewish athletes have made their names at the Maccabiah, including American swimmers Mark Spitz, who went on to win an unprecedented seven gold medals at the 1972 Olympics, and Lenny Krayzelburg, who won four gold medals in his career.<br><br>

At the 2017 Maccabiah Games, a special 4 x 50 meter relay race was held between Israeli and American all-star teams, American Olympic champions Krayzelburg, Jason Lezak (four Olympic golds), and Anthony Ervin (three Olympic golds), with masters swimmer Alex Blavatnik defeated Israeli Olympians Guy Barnea, Yoav Bruck, Eran Groumi, and Tal Stricker.<br><br>

<span id="newSport" style="color:red">New Sports</span><br><br><br>
English speaking immigrants have brought a number of sports to the country. The Israel Baseball League played professional baseball for a year in 2007. In 2017, the Israeli World Baseball Classic team began the Classic with four straight wins, including victories over powerhouses South Korea and Cuba. Although baseball is not widely played in Israel, the WBC team (composed mostly of American Jews) hopes to raise awareness about the sport in Israel.<br><br>

Other sports popular among English speakers are cricket and American football. Israel is a member of the International Cricket Association (ICA). New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft has promoted playing American football by building two stadiums in Jerusalem. There is an American flag football league includes dozens of teams competing for the Holy Land Bowl each season.<br><br>

The Israel Lacrosse Association has grown exponentially since its inception in 2010, and now boasts an 8-city league with a budget of over $4.8 million. In 2016, the Israeli team earned a silver medal at the European Lacrosse Championships, and the team won first place in the 2017 European Indoor Lacrosse Championships. The Israel Lacrosse Association was chosen to host the World Lacrosse Championship in 2018 after Manchester, UK had to back out because of financial problems. The event was the largest in the championship’s fifty year history, with 46 teams vying for the title in Netanya.<br><br>

Indian and South African immigrants brought rugby and lawn bowling to the country.<br><br>

<span id="cycling" style="color:red">Cycling</span><br><br><br>
Israel has one professional cycling team, the Israel Cycling Academy. The first Olympic indoor cycling arena in the Middle East, dubbed the Sylvan Adams Velodrome, was unveiled near Israel’s National Sports Center in May 2018.<br><br>

The largest cycling event in the world outside of the Tour de France, the Giro d’Italia, began in Israel in May 2018, the first time the race had ever been held outside of Europe. Participants spent three days cycling through Israel, beginning in Jerusalem and ending near Eilat and the Mitzpeh Ramon Crater. Following the Israeli leg of the race, the participants went on to Italy. Twenty-two teams from twenty countries participated, including teams representing Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.<br><br>

<span id="disabled" style="color:red">Sports for the Disabled</span><br><br><br>
Israel sent 42 athletes to the 2008 Paralympic Games in Beijing, competing in archery, athletics, basketball, cycling, equestrian, rowing, sailing, shooting, swimming, table tennis and tennis. The team came home with five silver medals and one bronze. Keren Leibowitz is Israel’s most celebrated Paralympic athlete, having won three gold medals in swimming competitions in Sydney in 2000, three World Championships, and five European Championships. Swimmer Inbal Pezaro, runner Moran Samuel and shooter Doron Shaziri won Israel three bronze medals at the 2016 Paralympic games in Rio de Janiero, Brazil.<br><br>

The Israeli wheelchair tennis team came home with a silver medal in doubles from the BNP Paribas World Team Cup, held in Alghero, Italy in May 2017. The team had previously won the gold medal at the 2012 World Team Cup in South Korea, and the bronze medal at the 2014 competition in the Netherlands.<br><br>

In October 2017, an Israeli team participated for the first time in the European Para Youth Games held in Liguria, Italy. The games included over 600 Paralympic teenage athletes from 24 European countries participating in eleven sporting events such as archery, bocce, soccer, judo, and table tennis. The Israeli team took home eight medals from their first trip to the European Para Youth Games: three gold, two silver, and three bronze.<br><br>

The Israel Sports Association for the Disabled (ISAD) conducts a wide range of activities in many fields, including basketball, tennis, volleyball, badminton, table tennis, shooting, riding, archery, swimming, and sailing. The Sports Beit Halohem clubs for disabled army veterans and the Ilan organization for the disabled through injury and illness also offer numerous sporting activities.<br><br>

Two Israeli paralympic athletes brought home gold medals in swimming from the European Paralympic championship in August 2018.  Israeli athletes Inbal Pezaro and Ami Dadaon finished in first place in the 200m and 100m freestyle events, respectively. Pezaro, 31, has represented Israel in the paralympic games since 2004, and has won four Olympic silver medals and five Olympic bronze medals. The 2018 European Paralympic championship was 17-year old Dadaon's first European championship competition.   <p>
